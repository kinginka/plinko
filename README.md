# Plinko.js

## Introduction

Plinko.js is a real-time, multiplayer, physics-based game using only JavaScript and the basic features of a browser. The clients and authoritative server communicate over WebSockets, and the game employ snapshots and extrapolation to synchronize game state across nodes. To optimize bandwidth, it compresses network data using quantization and binary serialization. The game lobby and player matchmaking system is built with React.

Check out the Plinko.js [case study](http://www.plinkojs.com/about) to learn more, or [play a demo game](http://www.plinkojs.com/play).

## Installation

1) run `yarn install` in `/client`
2) run `npm install` in the root folder
3) run `npm run compile` to transpile the server side code
4) run `npm start` to run the development server on localhost:3000

_Note: If you wish to run the server elsewhere, you must change `localhost:3001` in `client/src/components/App.js` to your domain at port 3001_
